Briefly documents the changes made to Gallery v3.1.5 to suit migration from a Gallery2 website to provide a similar look and feel to users and the admins.

Winmerge files describe the changes made to customise Gallery the Revival. Download and expand to view the WinMerge details of changes made to Gallery the Revival version of Gallery3 v3.1.5 to customise the website https://www.oldtoysandgames.com/gallery315/ which will be renamed to https://www.thejigasaurus.com/ after the domain for the old Gallery2 site is moved to the new host.

The modules activated for the installation are shown in the pdfs, as well as the order the modules are loaded. 

The modules used can be found at http://codex.galleryproject.org/Gallery3:Modules and https://github.com/gallery/gallery3. 

The theme used is Grey Dragon 4.0.2 which can be downloaded from https://blog.dragonsoft.us/gallery-3/, which also requires the greydragon module.

For completeness, all required files are included here: Gallery v315 initial files for installation on a web server with PHP and mySQL, the guide to installing Gallery3, plus the modules and theme used. The modules and theme include all the customisations made to these files - further customisations were made to other installation files as documented in the Winmerge report.
